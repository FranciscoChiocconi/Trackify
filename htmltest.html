	The best way to manage this problem is to regulate the usage of money and establish good credit for each individual based on their needs and priorities. The app, Budget App, appears to be a normal budget app, however, the Budget App outweighs all other budget apps with its unique modifiable features and techniques. It’s easy to use, and will be compatible to most devices. The Budget App is catered towards young adults and teens, in the Tri Valley Area which includes the cities Dublin, Livermore, and Pleasanton in the Bay Area of California. Moreover, the Budget App calculates taxes for these cities, to provide users a more efficient and hassle free experience. Adding on, the Budget App allows customers to choose a specific setting for what they would wish to monitor. For example, users can select an option that is based on how much they spend, how much they would like to save (which will include in app recommendations for other products based on interests or viewing/search histories), or simply set a limit of expenditure per day/week/month/year. 
With the usage of an app to calculate costs and taxes, young adults are setting themselves up for continuing a life of good credit and are going to be significantly more educated regarding money and expenditure.
The creation of the Budget App will require developers and developing programs. Though it may not cost much money to make, it will take approximately ten weeks to officially set up and build a base foundation for the app, in addition to another possible ten weeks for testing and making any necessary edits. 
To test the product, the permission of multiple volunteers to try the app will be vital. This way, it’ll be assistive to the team behind the app to be able to make any changes to the app before officially releasing it.

            Unique Proposition
              </h2>
              <p class="lefte">
               Unlike other budget apps, this Budget App provides a customizable and special experience to users. Users are able to set up the app to calculate taxes according to their city. Instructions are built in to the app, making this step by step process incredibly easy to follow. 
              It is much easier to use an app on common devices such as a smartphone to consider prices. In addition to features and products that allow customers to store money digitally, or on their phone, the added budget tracker on the same device allows for faster and easier compatibility. 
The app only costs 2 dollars per download, whereas other budget apps charge much more, but offer less features. Many budget apps also are free, but aren’t nearly as compatible for users as promised. Since this product is marketed towards mainly those who have issues managing their money, 2 dollars is quite a worthwhile investment, considering the amount of money that will be saved versus 2 dollars spent. 
This app will provide a backbone to young developing teenagers and teach them about how important it is to follow a budget. Additionally, this sets up our future generation with a skill set suitable for any future plans or projects that will not only benefit them, but also those around them.
This budget app is unique with its tax calculations based on where the user lives within the Tri Valley Area. These included tax calculations give customers and sellers more security and comfort, knowing exactly how much they can sell and buy.

               	The app will begin at two dollars per download. The development of the app will not cost much money, but it will require a large amount of time to facilitate changes and features into the app. Customers will be able to locate and download the app from the App Store provided by Apple and Android. Since the app is made specially for people in the Tri Valley Area (cities Dublin, Livermore, and Pleasanton in California), it will be restricted to only people in this location. Meaning this app will be only accessible by people living in this area, as it has been customized to fit the needs of a citizen of the Tri Valley Area.
