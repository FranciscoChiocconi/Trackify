                Budgeting is a wonderful asset that can improve one’s financial health significantly. However, a lack of proper budgeting, budgeting programs, and apps have led to teenagers and young adults who would prefer guidance for budgeting, to altogether disregard budgeting or not properly account for various other factors, thus leading to debt, or unwanted purchases that cannot be afforded. Moreover, it has been studied that failure to implement financial organization planning can thwart any success in projects that involve large funds or specific payment standards. Due to the lack of budgeting many companies and projects have failed, which is why no one ever has heard of them, because they failed very early on. Consequently, some form of budgeting should be prevalent in consumers’ lives, and the most efficient way to supply easy budgeting is through apps.

                Currently, teenagers and young adults are spending excessive money and thus are more susceptible to falling into debt. For example within the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, most students in the Tri Valley Area belong to middle class or upper class families. Money is still something that needs to be coordinated by everyone eventually. Furthermore, it has been observed in high schools within the Tri Valley Area that surveyed upperclassmen students spend money at restaurants or invest in common, trendy locations similar to T4 or Starbucks. Though this may seem fun or harmless, this is not establishing the mentality most young adults need to keep in mind; being able to effectively determine your own payments for taxes, necessities, and other desires. Excess money spent equals hard earned money wasted.
