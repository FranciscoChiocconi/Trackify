  Solution
</h1>
    <p >
 The best way to manage this roblem is to regulate the usage of money and establish good credit for each individual based on their needs and riorities. The a, Budget A, aears to be a normal budget a, however, the Budget A outweighs all other budget as with its unique modifiable features and techniques. It’s easy to use, and will be comatible to most devices. The Budget A is catered towards young adults and teens, in the Tri Valley Area which includes the cities Dublin, Livermore, and leasanton in the Bay Area of California. Moreover, the Budget A calculates taxes for these cities, to rovide users a more efficient and hassle free exerience. Adding on, the Budget A allows customers to choose a secific setting for what they would wish to monitor. For examle, users can select an otion that is based on how much they send, how much they would like to save (which will include in a recommendations for other roducts based on interests or viewing/search histories), or simly set a limit of exenditure er day/week/month/year. 
With the usage of an a to calculate costs and taxes, young adults are setting themselves u for continuing a life of good credit and are going to be significantly more educated regarding money and exenditure.
The creation of the Budget A will require develoers and develoing rograms. Though it may not cost much money to make, it will take aroximately ten weeks to officially set u and build a base foundation for the a, in addition to another ossible ten weeks for testing and making any necessary edits. 
To test the roduct, the ermission of multile volunteers to try the a will be vital. This way, it’ll be assistive to the team behind the a to be able to make any changes to the a before officially releasing it.
